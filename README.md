# Plagiarism Detection System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting plagiarism in textual content. It uses various algorithms and techniques to analyze documents for similarity, providing an essential tool for educators, content creators, and anyone needing to ensure originality in written work.

## Features
- Document upload interface
- Plagiarism scoring based on advanced algorithms
- Detailed report generation
- Support for multiple file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .txt)

## Getting Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide to get the Plagiarism Detection System up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these instructions to install the project and run it.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**: The project is developed with Python, so you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **pip**: Ensure pip, Python’s package installer, is installed. It usually comes with Python.

- **Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**: It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate. Install virtualenv via pip if you don't have it:
  ```bash
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the project repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsSimon-cse/Plagiarism-Detection-System-.git
   ```
   This command downloads the project files to your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Plagiarism-Detection-System-
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   This creates a new virtual environment called `env` and activates it.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the necessary Python packages.

### Running the Application

After installing the project and its dependencies, you're ready to run the application:

1. **Start the Application**: Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Replace `app.py` with the name of the main script if it's different.

2. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   This should open the homepage of the Plagiarism Detection System, where you can start using the application.
